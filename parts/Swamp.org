* Swamp Denizens
** Bakunawa Solitary, Large, Intelligent, Messy, Forceful
*Bite (d10+3 damage, 1 piercing) 16 HP 2 Armor*
*Close, Reach*
*Special Qualities:* Amphibious
Dragon-Turtle’s sister is a mighty serpent queen. Ten yards of scales and
muscle, they say she wakes with a hunger when the sun disappears from the sky.
She is attracted by bright light in the darkness and like any snake, the
Bakunawa is sneaky. She will seek first to beguile and mislead and will only
strike out with violence when no other option is available. When she does,
though, her jaws are strong enough to crack the hull of any swamp-boat and
certainly enough to slice through a steel breastplate or two. Give the greedy
snake your treasures and she might just leave you alone. /Instinct/: To devour
    - Lure prey with lies and illusions
    - Lash out at light
    - Devour
** Basilisk Solitary, Hoarder
*Bite (d10 damage) 12 HP 2 Armor*
*Close*
“Few have seen a basilisk and lived to tell the tale. Get it? Seen a basilisk?
Little bit of basilisk humor there. Sorry, I know you’re looking for something
helpful, sirs. Serious stuff, I understand. The basilisk, even without its
ability to turn your flesh to stone with a gaze, is a dangerous creature. A bit
like a frog, bulbous eyes and six muscled legs built for leaping. A bit like an
alligator, with snapping jaws and sawing teeth. Covered in stony scales and very
hard to kill. Best avoided, if possible.” /Instinct/: To create new statuary
    - Turn flesh to stone with a gaze
    - Retreat into a maze of stone
** Black Pudding Solitary, Amorphous
*Corrosive touch (d10 damage, ignores armor) 15 HP 1 Armor*
*Close*
*Special Qualities:* Amorphous
How do you kill a pile of goo? A great, squishy pile of goo that also happens to
want to dissolve you and slurp you up? That is a good question to which I have
no answer. Do let us know when you find out. /Instinct/: To dissolve
    - Eat away metal, flesh, or wood
    - Ooze into a troubling place: food, armor, stomach
** Coutal Solitary, Intelligent Devious
*Light ray (d8 damage, ignores armor) 12 HP 2 Armor*
*Close*
*Special Qualities:* Wings, Halo
As if in direct defiance of the decay and filth of the world, the gods granted
us the coutal. As if to say, “there is beauty, even in this grim place.” A
serpent in flight on jeweled wings, these beautiful creatures glow with a soft
light, as the sun does through stained glass. Bright, wise, and calm, a coutal
often knows many things and sees many more. You might be able to make a trade
with it in exchange for some favor. They seek to cleanse and to purge and to
make of this dark world a better one. Shame we have so few. The gods are cruel.
/Instinct/: To cleanse
    - Pass judgment on a person or place
    - Summon divine forces to cleanse
    - Offer information in exchange for service
** Crocodilian Group, Large
*Bite (d8+3 damage) 10 HP 2 Armor*
*Close, Reach*
*Special Qualities:* Amphibious, Camouflage
It’s a really, really big crocodile. Seriously. So big. /Instinct/: To eat
    - Attack an unsuspecting victim
    - Escape into the water
    - Hold something tight in its jaws
** Doppelgänger Solitary, Devious, Intelligent
*Dagger (d6 damage) 12 HP 0 Armor*
*Close*
*Special Qualities:* Shapeshifting
Their natural form, if you ever see it, is hideous. Like a creature who stopped
growing part-way, before it decided it was elf or man or dwarf. Then again,
maybe that’s how you get to be the way a doppelgänger is—without form, without
shape to call their own, maybe all they really seek is a place to fit in. If you
go out into the world, when you come back home, make sure your friends are who
you think they are. They might, instead, be a doppelgänger and your friend might
be dead at the bottom of a well somewhere. Then again, depending on your
friends, that might be an improvement. /Instinct/: To infiltrate
    - Assume the shape of a person whose flesh it’s tasted
    - Use another’s identity to advantage
    - Leave someone’s reputation shattered
** Dragon Turtle Solitary, Huge, Cautious
*Bite (d10+3 damage) 20 HP 4 Armor*
*Reach*
*Special Qualities:* Shell, Amphibious
Bakunawa has a brother. Where she is quick to anger and hungry for gold, he is
slow and sturdy. She is a knife and he is a shield. A great turtle that lies in
the muck and mire for ages as they pass, mud piled upon his back—sometimes trees
and shrubs. Sometimes a whole misguided clan of goblins will build their huts
and cook their ratty meals on the shell of the dragon turtle. His snapping jaws
may be glacier-slow, but they can rend a castle wall. Careful where you tread.
/Instinct/: To resist change
    - Move forward implacably
    - Bring its full bulk to bear
    - Destroy structures and buildings
** Dragon Whelp Solitary, Small, Intelligent, Cautious, Hoarder
*Elemental breath (d10+2 damage) 16 HP 3 Armor*
*Close, Near*
*Special Qualities:* Wings, Elemental Blood
What? Did you think they were all a mile long? Did you think they didn’t come
smaller than that? Sure, they may be no bigger than a dog and no smarter than an
ape, but a dragon whelp can still belch up a hellish ball of fire that’ll melt
your armor shut and drop you screaming into the mud. Their scales, too, are
softer than those of their bigger kin, but can still turn aside an arrow or
sword not perfectly aimed. Size is not the only measure of might. /Instinct/: To
grow in power
    - Start a lair, form a base of power
    - Call on family ties
    - Demand oaths of servitude
** Ekek Horde
*Talons (d6 damage) 3 HP 1 Armor*
*Close*
*Special Qualities:* Wing-arms
Ugly, wrinkled bird-folk, these. Once, maybe, in some ancient past, they were a
race of angelic men from on high, but now they eat rats that they fish from the
murk with talon-feet and devour with needle-teeth. They understand the tongues
of men and dwarves but speak in little more than gibbering tongues, mimicking
the words they hear with mocking laughter. It’s a chilling thing to see a beast
so close to man or bird but not quite either one. /Instinct/: To lash out
    - Attack from the air
    - Carry out the bidding of a more powerful creature
** Fire Eels Horde, Tiny
*Burning touch (d6-2 damage, ignores armor) 3 HP 0 Armor*
*Hand*
*Special Qualities:* Flammable oil, aquatic
These strange creatures are no bigger or smarter than their mundane kin. They
have the same vicious nature. Over their relations they have one advantage—an
oily secretion that oozes from their skin. It makes them hard to catch. On top
of that, with a twist of their body they can ignite the stuff, leaving pools of
burning oil atop the surface of the water and roasting prey and predator alike.
I hear the slimy things make good ingredients for fire-resistant gear, but you
have to get your hands on one, first. /Instinct/: To ignite
    - Catch someone or something on fire (even underwater)
    - Consume burning prey
** Frogman Horde, Small, Intelligent
*Spear (d6 damage) 7 HP 1 Armor*
*Close*
*Special Qualities:* Amphibious
Croak croak croak. Little warty munchkins. Some wizard or godling’s idea of a
bad joke, these creatures are. They stand as men, dress in scavenged cloth and
hold court in their froggy villages. They speak a rumbling pidgin form of the
tongue of man and are constantly at war with their neighbors. They’re greedy and
stupid but clever enough when they need to defend themselves. Some say, too,
their priests have a remarkable skill at healing. Or maybe they’re just really,
really hard to kill. /Instinct/: To wage war
    - Launch an amphibious assault
    - Heal at a prodigious rate
** Hydra Solitary, Large
*Bite (d10+3 damage) 16 HP 2 Armor*
*Close, Reach*
*Special Qualities:* Many heads, Only killed by a blow to the heart
A bit like a dragon, wingless though it may be. Heads, nine in number at birth,
spring from a muscled trunk and weave a sinuous pattern in the air. A hydra is
to be feared—a scaled terror of the marsh. The older ones, though, they have
more heads, for every failed attempt to murder it just makes it stronger. Cut
off a head and two more grow in its place. Only a strike, true and strong, to
the heart can end a hydra’s life. Not time or tide or any other thing but this.
/Instinct/: To grow
    - Attack many enemies at once
    - Regenerate a body part (especially a head)
** Kobold Horde, Small, Stealthy, Intelligent, Organized
*Spear (d6 damage) 3 HP 1 Armor*
*Close, Reach*
*Special Qualities:* Dragon connection
Some are wont to lump these little, rat-like dragon-men in with goblins and
orcs, bugbears and hobgoblins. They are smarter and wiser than their kin,
however. The kobolds are beholden slaves to dragons and were, in ancient times,
their lorekeepers and sorcerer-servants. Their clans, with names like Ironscale
and Whitewing, form around a dragon master and live to serve and do its bidding.
Spotting a kobold means more are near—and if more are near then a mighty dragon
cannot be far, either. /Instinct/: To serve dragons
    - Lay a trap
    - Call on dragons or draconic allies
    - Retreat and regroup
** Lizardman Group, Stealthy, Intelligent, Organized
*Spear (d8 damage) 6 HP 2 Armor*
*Close, Reach*
*Special Qualities:* Amphibious
A traveling sorcerer once told me that lizardmen came before we did. That before
elves and dwarves and men built even the first of their wattle huts, a race of
proud lizard kings strode the land. That they lived in palaces of crystal and
worshipped their own scaly gods. Maybe that’s true and maybe it ain’t—now they
dwell in places men long forgot or abandoned, crafting tools from volcano-glass
and lashing against the works of the civilized world. Maybe they just want back
what they lost. /Instinct/: To destroy civilization
    - Ambush the unsuspecting
    - Launch an amphibious assault
** Medusa Solitary, Devious, Intelligent, Hoarder
*Claws (d6 damage) 12 HP 0 Armor*
*Close*
*Special Qualities:* Look turns you to stone
The medusa are children of a serpent-haired mother, birthing them in ancient
times to bear her name across the ages. They dwell near places of
civilization—luring folks to their caves with promises of beauty or riches
untold. Fine appreciators of art, the medusa curate strange collections of their
victims, terror or ecstasy frozen forever in stone. It satisfies their vanity to
know they were the last thing seen in so many lives. Arrogant, proud, and
spiteful, in their way, they seek what so many do—endless company. /Instinct/:
To collect
    - Turn a body part to stone with a look
    - Draw someone’s gaze
    - Show hidden terrible beauty
** Sahuagin Horde, Intelligent
*Endless teeth (d6+4 damage, 1 piercing) 3 HP 2 Armor*
*Close, Forceful, Messy*
*Special Qualities:* Amphibious
The shape and craft of men wedded to the hunger and the endless teeth of a
shark. Voracious and filled only with hate, these creatures will not stop until
all life has been consumed. They cannot be reasoned with, they cannot be
controlled or sated. They are hunger and bloodlust, driven up from the depths of
the sea to ravage coastal towns and swallow island villages. /Instinct/: To
spill blood
    - Bite off a limb
    - Hurl a poisoned spear
    - Frenzy at the sight of blood
** Sauropod Group, Huge, Cautious
*Trample (d10+5 damage) 18 HP 4 Armor*
*Reach*
*Special Qualities:* Armor plated body
Great lumbering beasts, they live in places long since forgotten by the thinking
races of the world. Gentle if unprovoked, but mighty if their ire is raised,
they trample smaller creatures with the care we might give to crushing an ant
beneath our boots. If you see one, drift by and gaze in awe, but do not wake the
giant. /Instinct/: To endure
    - Stampede
    - Knock something down
    - Unleash a deafening bellow
** Swamp Shambler Solitary, Large, Magical
*Lash (d10+1 damage) 23 HP 1 Armor*
*Close, Reach, Forceful*
*Special Qualities:* Swamp form
Some elementals are conjured up in sacred circles etched in chalk. Most, in
fact. There’s a sort of science to it. Others, though, aren’t so orderly—they
don’t fall under the carefully controlled assignments of fire, air, water, or
earth. Some are a natural confluence of vine and mire and fungus. They do not
think the way a man might think. They cannot be understood as one might
understand an elf. They simply are. Spirits of the swamp. Shamblers in the mud.
/Instinct/: To preserve and create swamps
    - Call on the swamp itself for aid
    - Meld into the swamp
    - Reassemble into a new form
** Troll Solitary, Large
*Club (d10+3 damage) 20 HP 1 Armor*
*Close, Reach, Forceful*
*Special Qualities:* Regeneration
Tall. Real tall. Eight or nine feet when they’re young or weak. Covered all over
in warty, tough skin, too. Big teeth, stringy hair like swamp moss and long,
dirty nails. Some are green, some gray, some black. They’re clannish and hateful
of each other, not to mention all the rest of us. Near impossible to kill, too,
unless you’ve fire or acid to spare—cut a limb off and watch. In a few days,
you’ve got two trolls where you once had one. A real serious problem, as you can
imagine. /Instinct/: To smash
    - Undo the effects of an attack (unless caused by a weakness, your call)
    - Hurl something or someone
** Will-o-wisp Solitary, Tiny, Magical
*Ray (w[2d8-2] damage) 12 HP 0 Armor*
*Near*
*Special Qualities:* Body of light
Spot a lantern floating in the darkness, lost traveler in the swamp. Hope—a
beacon of shimmering light. You call out to it, but there’s no answer. It begins
to fade and so you follow, sloshing through the muck, tiring at the chase,
hoping you’re being led to safety. Such a sad tale that always ends in doom.
These creatures are a mystery—some say they’re ghosts, others beacons of faerie
light. Nobody knows the truth. They are cruel, however. All can agree on that.
/Instinct/: To misguide
    - Lead someone astray
    - Clear a path to the worst place possible
