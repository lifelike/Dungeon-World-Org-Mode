* Instant NPCs
Sometimes the players will come across someone who becomes important in the
moment. When the ritual goes wrong and a poor captive gets the power cosmic what
does that villager do with it? Who were they?

When you need a quick NPC all you need is an instinct and some way to pursue it.
We call that a knack, it can be anything from a skill to a title to a debt owed.
Combine the two and you have an NPC who has something they want and a way to try
to get it—you’re ready to go.
